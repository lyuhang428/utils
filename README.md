### algorithms-learn
This folder contains naive implementation of data structure (far from completeness), ml algorithms (far from completeness), and some other things. 

### home-made Hartree Fock code
A home made minimistic code that does Hartree Fock level quantum chemistry calculation. I prioritize readability over performance. 

### quantum dynamics Lindbladian
Naive quantum dynamics related materials, introduing density matrix, Liouville space, and system-bath coupling in the Lindbladian scheme.
