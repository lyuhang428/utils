## utils

### 1. algorithms-learn
Naive implementation of data structure (far from completeness), ml algorithms (far from completeness), and some other things. 

### 2. home-made Hartree-Fock code
Home-made minimalistic implementation of Hartree-Fock calculation. Very easy to read and modify, but poor in performance and only deal with restricted closed-shell molecule and Cartesian basis functions. 

### 3. quantum dynamics in the Lindbladian scheme
Very fundamental quantum dynamics related materials, introduing density matrix, Liouville space, and system-bath coupling in the Lindbladian scheme. 


### 4. Toy atom DFT implementation
Conceptual DFT calculation on spherically symmetrical system (viz. atom). Only Hartree-Fock-Slater exchange functional is used. Basis functions are not what are used in a real DFT calculation, but just some Gaussian functions.
